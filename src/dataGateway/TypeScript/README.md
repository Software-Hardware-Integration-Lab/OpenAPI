# SHI Data Gateway - TypeScript SDK

This SDK provides a convenient TypeScript client for interacting with the SHI Data Gateway service. It is automatically generated from the OpenAPI specification located at [`Data-Gateway.json`](../../../specs/Data-Gateway.json) using [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota).

All typing data is included in the package.

## Installation

Install the SDK using npm:

```bash
npm install @shi-corp/sdk-data-gateway
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the SDK:

```TypeScript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from '@azure/identity'
import { dataGatewayClientFactory } from '@shi-corp/sdk-data-gateway';

/** Authentication session used to authenticate to the SHI Data Gateway. */
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

/** Configured client for the data gateway that can make authenticated web requests against SDG. */
const sdgClient = dataGatewayClientFactory(credential);

/** Collection of correlation records representing the available list of license reports for the current authenticated tenant. */
const results = await sdgClient.api.licenseReport.correlation.get();

// Loop through each available license report
for (const correlationRecord of results) {
    // Do something here
}
```
